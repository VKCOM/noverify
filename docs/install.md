# Installation

## Composer â€” the easiest way

> Can only be installed via Composer 2. See https://blog.packagist.com/composer-2-0-is-now-available/

Run the following command:

```shell
composer require --dev vkcom/noverify:dev-master
```

After NoVerify is installed as a dependency, run the following command to download the binary.

```shell
./vendor/bin/noverify-get
```

The ready-to-run binary will be placed in the same folder and can be launched with the next command:

```shell
./vendor/bin/noverify
```

By default, the latest available version is downloaded, but you can install other versions, see help command for details.

For example:

```shell
./vendor/bin/noverify-get --version 0.3.0
```

## Ready binaries

Go to the [Releases](https://github.com/vkcom/noverify/releases) page and download the latest version for your OS.

Check that it launches correctly:

```bash
noverify version
```

*(here and then, we suppose that the `noverify` binary is available by name)*

You're done! Proceed to the [Getting started](/docs/getting_started.md) page.

## With `go get`

Make sure you have [Go](https://golang.org/dl/) version 1.16 or higher installed.  
Run the following command:

```shell
$ go get github.com/VKCOM/noverify
```

NoVerify will be installed to `$GOPATH/bin/noverify`, which usually expands to `$HOME/go/bin/noverify`.

For convenience, you can add this folder to the **PATH**.

## Build from source

Make sure you have [Go](https://golang.org/dl/) version 1.16 or higher installed.  
Clone this repository and run `make build`:

```shell
git clone https://github.com/vkcom/noverify
cd noverify
make build
```

Optionally, you can pass a name of the binary:

```shell
make build BIN_NAME=noverify.bin
```

A resulting binary will be placed in the `./build` folder.
