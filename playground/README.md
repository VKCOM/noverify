# NoVerify Playground

The Playground is a web page where you can look at the warnings that NoVerify finds.

To run it locally run the following commands from the root of the project.

```shell
make playground
```

Then open http://localhost:8080/ in your browser and enjoy!

> If you are using the Safari browser, the playground may not work correctly.
