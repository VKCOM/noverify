## NoVerify ![Build Status](https://github.com/VKCOM/noverify/workflows/Go/badge.svg)

![](/docs/noverify_small.png)

NoVerify is a PHP linter: it finds possible bugs and style violations in your code.

* NoVerify has no config: any reported issue in your PHPDoc or PHP code must be fixed.
* NoVerify aims to understand PHP code at least as well as PHPStorm does. If it behaves incorrectly or suboptimally, please [report issue](https://github.com/VKCOM/noverify/issues/new).
* This tool is written in [Go](https://golang.org/) and uses [z7zmey/php-parser](https://github.com/z7zmey/php-parser).

## Features

1. Fast: analyze ~100k LOC/s (lines of code per second) on Core i7.
2. Incremental: can analyze changes in git and show only new reports. Indexing speed is ~1M LOC/s.
3. Experimental language server for VS Code and other editors that support language server protocol.
4. Auto fixes for some warnings (when -fix flag is provided).

## Default lints

NoVerify by default has the following checks:

- Unreachable code
- Array access to non-array type 
- Too few arguments when calling a function/method
- Call to undefined function/method
- Fetching of undefined constant/class property
- Class not found
- PHPDoc is incorrect
- Undefined variable
- Variable not always defined
- Case without "break;"
- Syntax error
- Unused variable
- Incorrect access to private/protected elements
- Incorrect implementation of IteratorAggregate interface
- Incorrect array definition, e.g. duplicate keys
