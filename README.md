## NoVerify

NoVerify is a PHP linter: it finds possible bugs and style violations in your code.

- NoVerify has no config: any reported issue in your PHPDoc or PHP code must be fixed.
- NoVerify aims to understand PHP code at least as well as PHPStorm does. If it behaves incorrectly or sub optimally, please [report issue](https://github.com/VKCOM/noverify/issues/new).
- This tool is written in [Go](https://golang.org/) and uses fork of [z7zmey/php-parser](https://github.com/VKCOM/php-parser).

## Features

1. Fast: analyze ~100k LOC/s (lines of code per second) on Core i7;
2. Incremental: can analyze changes in git and show only new reports. Indexing speed is ~1M LOC/s;
3. Auto fixes for some warnings;
4. PHP 7 and PHP 8 support;
5. Diff and baseline modes support.

## Default lints

NoVerify by default has the following checks:

- Unreachable code
- Too few arguments when calling a function/method
- Call to undefined function/method
- Fetching of undefined constant/class property
- Class not found
- PHPDoc is incorrect
- Undefined variable
- Variable not always defined
- Case without `break;`
- Syntax error
- Unused variable
- Incorrect access to private/protected elements
- Incorrect implementation of `IteratorAggregate` interface
- Incorrect array definition, e.g. duplicate keys
- And others, you can see the entire list [here](/docs/checkers_doc.md)
